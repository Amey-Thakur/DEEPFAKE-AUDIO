# DEEPFAKE-AUDIO

👉 An audio deepfake occurs when a "cloned" voice, potentially indistinguishable from the original subject, is used to produce synthetic audio.

### Overview

This project implements **Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS)**, utilizing a real-time vocoder for high-fidelity audio synthesis.

SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that generates a numerical representation of a voice from just a few seconds of audio, which is then used to condition a text-to-speech model for generating new vocalizations.
